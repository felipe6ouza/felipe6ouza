### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an beginner .NET Developer, my first step with the platform was with Xamarin.Forms and currently I have focused on studies in ASP.NET Core. 
I work as a back-end developer at Protech Solutions. I'm halfway through my degree in Information Systems from the Federal University of Sergipe. ðŸš€
