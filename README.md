### Hi there 👋

<!--
**felipe6ouza/felipe6ouza** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm an early .NET Developer, my first step with the platform was with Xamarin.Forms e and currently I have focused on studies in ASP.NET Core looking for my first job as a back-end developer. I had a volunteer experience previously as a Wordpress Developer for 18 months at Junior Enterprise Softeam. I'm halfway through my degree in Information Systems from the Federal University of Sergipe. 🚀
