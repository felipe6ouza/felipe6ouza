### Hi there 👋

I'm an beginner .NET Developer, my first step with the platform was with Xamarin.Forms and currently I have focused on studies in ASP.NET Core looking for my first job as a jr. back-end developer. I had a volunteer experience previously as a Wordpress Developer for 18 months at Junior Enterprise Softeam. I'm halfway through my degree in Information Systems from the Federal University of Sergipe. 🚀
