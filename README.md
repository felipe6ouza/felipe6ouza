### Hi there 👋 

I am a .NET developer 👨‍💻  working at Banese Card, with a focus on developing payment solutions and credit card service using .NET for Web APIs and back-end applications. Currently, I am pursuing a degree 🎓  in Information Systems from the Federal University of Sergipe. I enjoy discussing software architecture. Lastly, it's worth mentioning that I am an avid coffee ☕ enthusiast.


PS: I have some private repositories for my personal projects, and I plan to make them public when they are in the mature stage of development. I promise to do so. 🫡
